TODO - Update expression printing to renumber id-codes from Xi to X,Y,Z, then X1,X2,... for 4+
^^^ 12/19/12
TODO - Write tests for RicoNumber::Pow, especially corner cases
^^^ 12/13/12
DONE - Flesh out: RicoNumber::Power
^^^ 12/06/12
TODO - Make sure the number appears first in a sum and a product.
^^^ 12/04/12
TODO - Write tests for Double+Double and Double*Double
^^^ 11/29/12
DONE - Move to a static implementation for RicoSimplifyVisitor
DONE - Change the name from RicoSimplifyVisitor to RicoSimplify
^^^ 11/20/12
DONE - Created separate registry for BasicRV's and R interface. BasicRV's automatically registered.
DONE - The collectBasicRVs() should pass set<RicoID> and therefore not need "This" RicoPtr.
DONE - Replace 'RicoPtr Wrt" with "RicoID Wrt" where RicoID is an int for now.
^^^^ 11/13/12
DONE - The RicoSumProduct::getExpression needs to build an expression, not just write one.
DONE - RicoSumProduct ctor needs to avoid iiMap copy.
^^^^ 11/08/12
DONE - Wrap RicoPtr around all new calls by creating static Rico::XX(...)
^^^^ 11/08/12
TODO - Decide if we have achieved a canonical expression form using Simplify rules.
DONE - Reduced Fraction on Create.
DONT - Create Copy Constructor for Rico
^^^^ 11/06/12
DONE - Consider replacing vector<RicoPtr> with list<RicoPtr> for operands. Called vRicoPtr.
DONT - Introduce Triple as a template. Triple<T>
DONE - Update Pair to be a STL std::pair<T> 
^^^^ 11/05/12
TODO - Auto build UnitTest++ (if library missing.)
TODO - Autogenerate source code dependency information
^^^^ 10/30/12
DONE - Re-introduce testing.
DONE - replace boost::shared_ptr with erich::smart_ptr
DONE - Fix the compile dependency deficiency
^^^^ 10/22/12
DONE - Introduce Smart Pointers for Rico objects. Pass RicoPtr instead of Rico*
DONE - Move testing code to TestRico.cpp instead of CreateRico.cpp.
^^^^ 10/16/12
DONE - Consider replacing Rico* with Rico&
DONE - Ensure that ~Rico::delete works correctly.
DONE - Create copy-constructors for all Rico objects except BasicRV's?
DONE - Make sure remaining object compute derivatives. All derivatives computable.
DONE - Introduce Sqrt() function. Only took 15 minutes.
^^^^ 10/12/12
DONE - Consider bottom-up expresion simplifier.
DONE - Issue Rico.id on demand from R/C-interface only.
TODO - Save the world.
DONE - Create TODO list.
^^^^ 10/11/12 ^^^^ Bottom of List --- New items on top. --------------------------
