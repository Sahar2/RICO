\section{An Exemplary 2D Sharp Example}

The example presented here is small enough to describe in full detail and incorporate many of the key features of algebraically correlated random variables described in this work. Presented in two stages, first with sharp inputs replicating an example from Gass \cite{gass75} and the second with algebraically correlated random variable inputs. We will then describe how the example may be generalized.

The basis for the tables and chairs example can be found in Gass \cite{gass75} wherein a decision must be made by a small furniture manufacturer under resource constraints. The choice is whether to manufacture tables or chair or some combination of both. The goal is to maximize the revenue from the sale of the tables and chairs assuming that all will be sold. The specifics are,

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is 400 board-feet of wood available.
\item There is 450 man-hours of labor available.
\item It takes 5 board-feet of wood and 10 man-hours of labor to make a chair.
\item It takes 20 board-feet of wood and 15 man-hours of labor to make a table.
\item Chairs sell for \$45 each.
\item Tables sell for \$80 each.
\end{enumerate}

Stating the problem in standard form according to Boyd \cite{boyd04}
and Greenberg \cite{greenberg95},

\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} && 45 x_c + 80 x_t\\
\text{s.t.}     && 5 x_c + 20 x_t \le 400\\
                && 10 x_c + 15 x_t \le 450\\
                && x_c, x_t \ge 0
\end{align*}

where $x_c$ represents the number of chairs to manufacture and sell
and $x_t$ represents the number of tables to manufacture and sell.

To form a baseline we will first solve this optimization problem using
the simplex method as described in the simplex method section. We will
then solve the problem again with the prices kept unknown. At that
point we will be ready to introduce random pricing into the problem.

\subsection{Tables and Chairs with All Inputs Sharp and Known}

The simplex method requires all constraints to be stated as equalities
so we introduce a slack variable into each inequality. The problem is
restated as,

\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} && 45 x_c + 80 x_t\\
\text{s.t.}     && 5 x_c + 20 x_t + s_W = 400\\
                && 10 x_c + 15 x_t + s_L\le 450\\
                && x_c, x_t, s_W, s_L \ge 0
\end{align*}

where $s_W$ is the slack variable for the wood resource equation and
$s_L$ is the slack variable for the labor resource equation. All
variables, $x_c$, $x_t$, $s_W$ and $s_L$ are constrained to be
non-negative.

Since each slack variable appears exclusively once in the constraint
equations and their coefficients are $+1$ they collectively form a
basis for the simplex tableau in table \ref{tab:tc0011}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | c c c c | c |}
\hline
        & $x_c$ & $x_t$ & $s_W$ & $s_L$ & $b$\\
\hline
$s_W$   & 5     & 20    & 1     & 0     & 400\\
$s_L$   & 10    & 15    & 0     & 1     & 450\\
\hline
Revenue & 45    & 80    & 0     & 0     &\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \caption[Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 0011]
          {Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 0011}
  \label{tab:tc0011}
\end{table}


The problem variables are collected into the list $X = (x_c, x_t, s_W,
s_L)$ and using the order of this list denote the variables in the
current basis with a $1$ and the others with a $0$ we describe the
current simplex state with the binary value,

\begin{align*}
State_0 = 0011
\end{align*}

To pivot the table we find the variable to enter the basis and the
basis variable to exit the basis. To find the entering variable we
compute the cost impact of each,

\begin{align*}
Z_c &= 45 - (5*0 + 10*0) &= 45\\
Z_t &= 80 - (20*0 + 15*0) &= 80
\end{align*}

where $Z_c$ is the cost impact of introducing variable $x_c$ into the
basis and $Z_t$ is the cost impact for $x_t$. Recall that increasing
$x_c$ the assumed zero value for a non-basis variable by one unit (one
more chair sold, for example) will increase revenue by the price of
one chair, $\$45$, and will decrease the slack variables $s_W$ and
$s_L$ by $5$ and $10$ units respectively. Since there is no revenue
impact to increasing or decreasing slack variables the revenue impact
is zero for each. 

The entering variable is selected as,
\begin{align*}
\text{argmax}\{Z_c, Z_t\} \implies x_t
\end{align*}

We now know that the next simplex state has the form $10??$ because
$x_c$ is the entering variable and where the question marks indicate
that we do no yet know the exiting variable. 

Since $x_t$ is the entering variable we divide $b = (400, 450)$
element-wise by the basis coefficients for $x_t$ namely $20$ and $15$
and find the minimum non-negative value. In particular one finds,
\begin{align*}
\text{argmin}\{\frac{400}{20}, \frac{450}{15}\} \implies s_W
\end{align*}

Since $\frac{400}{20} < \frac{450}{15}$ and the former value is
associated with basis variable $s_W$ it is chosen as the exit
variable. Recall that the reason is because we are allowing the
entering variable $x_t$ to increase from zero it forces the basis
variable in each equation toward zero. In the first equation a unit
increase in $x_t$ is a $20$ unit decrease in $s_W = 400$, but only a
$15$ unit decrease in $s_L = 450$. Since no variable is allowed to be
negative the we find which basis variable is driven to zero
first by an increase in the entering variable. We now see the new
simplex state to be,
\begin{align*}
State_1 = 0101
\end{align*}

To transform the equations and update the tableau we form the
transformation matrix to state $1$,  $B_1$ and its inverse as,
\begin{align*}
B_1 = \begin{pmatrix}20&0\\15&1\end{pmatrix} && B_1^{-1} = \frac{1}{20}\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\-15&20\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

recognizing each tableau column as a vector and multiplying on the
left by $B_1^{-1}$ we find the new tableau in table \ref{tab:tc0101}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | c c c c | c |}
\hline
        & $x_c$ & $x_t$ & $s_W$ & $s_L$ & $b$\\
\hline
$x_t$   & $\frac{1}{4}$     & 1    & $\frac{1}{20}$     & 0     & 20\\
$s_L$   & 6$\frac{1}{4}$    & 0    & -$\frac{3}{4}$     & 1     & 150\\
\hline
Revenue & 45    & 80    & 0     & 0     &\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \caption[Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 0101]
          {Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 0101}
  \label{tab:tc0101}
\end{table}


The two non-basis variables are now $x_c$ and $s_W$ so we find the
cost impact for introducing each into the basis,

\begin{align*}
Z_c &= 45 - (\frac{1}{4}*80 + 6\frac{1}{4}*0) &= 25\\
Z_w &= 0 - (\frac{1}{20}*80 - \frac{3}{4}*0) &= -4 
\end{align*}

where $Z_w$ is the cost impact of (re)-introducing $s_W$ into the
basis. Since $Z_w$ is negative, $s_W$ it is not eligible to be a
basis vector leaving $x_c$ as the only available choice for entering
variable.

Dividing $b$ by the vector of coefficients associated with $x_c$ and
finding the smallest non-negative value we have,

\begin{align*}
\text{argmin}\{20 \div \frac{1}{4}, 150 \div 6\frac{1}{4}\} =
\text{argmin}\{80, 24\} \implies s_L
\end{align*}

demonstrating the $s_L$ is the exiting variable. The $B_2$ basis
transformation matrix and its inverse become,

\begin{align*}
B_2 = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{4}&1\\6\frac{1}{4}&0\end{pmatrix} && B_2^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}0&0.16\\1&-0.04\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

The simplex state is then,
\begin{align*}
State_2 = 1100
\end{align*}

and the tableau for state 1100 is shown in table \ref{tab:tc1100}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | c c c c | c |}
\hline
        & $x_c$ & $x_t$ & $s_W$ & $s_L$ & $b$\\
\hline
$x_c$   & 1    & 0    & -0.12   & 0.16     & 24\\
$x_t$   & 0    & 1    & 0.08    & -0.04    & 14\\
\hline
Revenue & 45    & 80    & 0     & 0     &\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \caption[Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 1100]
          {Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 1100}
  \label{tab:tc1100}
\end{table}

We see that the two slack variables are no longer in the basis so they
are both zero. This means that at the current state we are using all
available resources to manufacture our tables and chairs. We ask if
either of the two slack variables should be re-introduced into the
basis by calculating the revenue impact for each,

\begin{align*}
Z_W &= 0 - (-0.12*45 + 0.08*80) &= -1\\
Z_L &= 0 - (0.16*45 - 0.04*80) &= -4
\end{align*}

Since each  cost impact is negative we conclude there is no possible
way to improve the revenue of the problem and the algorithm terminates
with the results,

\begin{align*}
x_c &= 24\\
x_t &= 14\\
revenue &= 24*45 + 14*80 = \$2,200
\end{align*}

since $(x_c, x_t) = b$. This means that the optimal choice for the
manufacturer is to make 24 chairs and 14 tables which, when sold, will
generate a revenue of $\$2,200$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=120mm]{Images/tables_and_chairs}
  \caption[Tables and Chairs Constraints and Optimal Point]
          {Tables and Chairs Constraints and Optimal Point}
  \label{fig:tables_and_chairs}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:tables_and_chairs} shows the resource constraints
(diagonal lines), the feasible region (shaded area) and the optimal
point, $(24,14)$. The simplex method starts at the origin in this case
and follows the heavy line in figure \ref{fig:tables_and_chairs} from
vertex to vertex of the polytope described by the half-space
constraints to the optimal vertex. We notice that in this case there
is an alternate vertex-path from the origin to the optimal vertex,
namely passing through point $(45,0)$. We will see that the choice of
vertex-path is significant in the next version of this example when we
leave the prices unknown.

\subsection{Tables and Chairs with Unknown Prices}

As an intermediate step we consider where uncertainty may be injected
into the tables and chairs example and decide that leaving the prices
sharp, but unknown leads to some revealing results.

A priori there are three places in the tables and chairs example where
uncertainty may be injected; the constraint vector $b$, the price
vector $p$ and the constraint matrix $A$ where,

\begin{align*}
A &= \begin{pmatrix}5&20\\10&15\end{pmatrix}\\
b &= \begin{pmatrix}400\\450\end{pmatrix}\\
p &= \begin{pmatrix}45&80\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

We recognize the values in the $A$ matrix as the amount of resources
of each type consumed to manufacture each kind of product, $b$ is the
number of resources of each kind available and $p$ is the prices
charged for each product.

Suppose that instead of the $5$ in matrix $A$ we introduced a random
variable. In the context of the tables and chairs example this means
that the manufacturer is uncertain about the amount of wood necessary
to construct a chair. We assume there is only one kind of chair else we
would likely call out the different kinds as different products and
give them separate variables. We make similar statements about each
value in the $A$ matrix. 

Since we are most interested in reflecting the AB32 reference model
into the tables and chairs example we elect not to introduce random
variables into the $A$ matrix. The reason is that the corresponding
$A$ matrix of the AB32 model represents policy features and physical
limitations which are assumed for the given policy under
consideration. 

To choose to introduce random variables into the $b$ or $p$ vectors we
must understand how they are used within the simplex algorithm. The
simplex method uses a \emph{pivot-table} approach whereby a column and
related row within the simplex tableau are chosen and a transition is
made to a new state within the algorithm. 

To choose the simplex tableau column we compare revenue impacts given
a choice of one of the non-basis variables. The values involved in
computing the revenue impact of each non-basis variable are prices and
products of prices and $A$ matrix coefficients from columns
corresponding to the non-basis variables. If we assume that the $A$
matrix values are fixed then we are comparing linear combinations of
$p$ vector prices to find the  non-basis variable corresponding to the
non-negative maximum of revenue impact values.

To choose the simplex tableau row given a column choice we compute the
quotient of $b$ and the values in $A$ corresponding to that
column. Thus we are comparing linear combinations of $b$ vector
values to find the basis variable corresponding to the the non-negative
minimum of linear combinations of constraint values.

We thus see that $p$ and $b$ values do not interact directly within
the simplex method. We will then choose the $p$ vector for
introduction of random variables suggesting, in the tables and chairs
example, price uncertainty over the $b$ vector values which would
suggest resource uncertainty. We will see that no new insight is
gained though choosing $b$ over $p$ or through choosing both for
random variable introduction. We will comment below on the choice of
$A$ for random variable introduction especially if $p$ or $b$ are
chosen as well. 

For this intermediate tables and chairs example we have unknown, but
sharp prices $p_c$ and $p_t$ for chairs and tables respectively. We
make one assumption about these unknown prices; they are positive. The
problem may then be stated in standard form as,

\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} && p_c * x_c + p_t * x_t\\
\text{s.t.}     && 5 x_c + 20 x_t \le 450\\
                && 10 x_c + 15 x_t \le 450\\
                && x_c, x_t \ge 0\\
                && p_c, p_t > 0
\end{align*}

The initial simplex tableau is shown in table \ref{tab:tcp0011}. The
only differences from the initial tableau of the first example is the
introduction of the state value $0011$ into the upper-left corner and
the unknown prices $p_c$ and $p_t$.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | c c c c | c |}
\hline
0011    & $x_c$ & $x_t$ & $s_W$ & $s_L$ & $b$\\
\hline
$s_W$   & 5     & 20    & 1     & 0     & 400\\
$s_L$   & 10    & 15    & 0     & 1     & 450\\
\hline
Revenue & $p_c$ & $p_t$ & 0     & 0     &\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \caption[Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 0011 with Unknown Prices]
          {Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 0011 with Unknown Prices}
  \label{tab:tcp0011}
\end{table}

Following the steps from the first example we must find the entering
non-basis variable by finding,

\begin{align*}
  &\text{argmax}\{p_c - (5*0 + 10*0), p_t - (20*0 + 15*0)\}\\
= &\text{argmax}\{p_c, p_t\}
\end{align*}

Since $p_c, p_t > 0$ neither case may be disqualified so we have some
possibilities. Either $p_c < p_t$ or $p_c > p_t$ or $p_c = p_t$. Since
we intend, in the next example, to introduce continuous random
variables in place of $p_c$ and $p_t$, equality occurs with
probability zero so we ignore that case here.

If $p_c > p_t$ then we choose $x_c$ as the entering variable. To find
the exiting variable we compute,

\begin{align*}
  &\text{argmin}\{\frac{400}{5}, \frac{450}{10}\}\\
= &\text{argmin}\{80, 45\} \implies s_L
\end{align*}

Since we have chosen $x_c$ as the entering variable and $s_L$ as the
exiting variable our new state is $1010$ and the transition matrix $B_{1010}$
and its inverse $B_{1010}^{-1}$ is,

\begin{align*}
B_{1010} = \begin{pmatrix}5&1\\10&0\end{pmatrix} && B_{1010}^{-1} = \frac{1}{10}\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\10&-5\end{pmatrix}\end{align*}

The new $1010$ tableau is shown in table \ref{tab:tcp1010}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | c c c c | c |}
\hline
1010    & $x_c$ & $x_t$ & $s_W$ & $s_L$ & $b$\\
\hline
$x_c$   & 1     & 1.5    & 0     & 0.1   & 45\\
$s_W$   & 0     & 12.5   & 1     & -0.5  & 175\\
\hline
Revenue & $p_c$ & $p_t$ & 0     & 0     &\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \caption[Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 1010 with Unknown Prices]
          {Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 1010 with Unknown Prices}
  \label{tab:tcp1010}
\end{table}

The non-basis variables are $x_t$ and $s_L$ so we compute the revenue
of (re)-introducing each of them, respectively, and find the entering variable,

\begin{align*}
   \text{argmax}\{p_t - (1.5*p_c + 12.5*0), 0 - (0.1*p_c - 0.5*0)\}
= &\text{argmax}\{p_t - 1.5*p_c , - 0.1*p_c\}
\end{align*}

Since $p_c > 0$ by assumption we have $-0.1*p_c < 0$ so it must be
disqualified as an option. We then ask, under what condition is the
first options positive? That is,

\begin{align*}
p_t - 1.5*p_c &> 0\\
p_t &> 1.5*p_c\\
\frac{2}{3}p_t &> p_c
\end{align*}

Since we have already assumed upon entering this case that $p_c > p_t$
it is not possible for $\frac{2}{3}p_t > p_c$. We therefore terminate
the simplex algorithm. Recalling that non-basis variables must be zero
we find the following results,

\begin{align*}
x_c &= 45\\
x_t &= 0\\
revenue &= 45p_c && \text{ for } p_t < p_c
\end{align*}

Returning to our first decision point we now assume $p_c < p_t$ as was
the case in the first example. The tableau under the assumption that
we transition from state $0011$ to state $0101$ is shown in table
\ref{tab:tcp0101} which we notice is similar to table
\ref{tab:tc0101} except for the unknown prices and the state being
recorded in the upper left corner of the tableau.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | c c c c | c |}
\hline
0101    & $x_c$ & $x_t$ & $s_W$ & $s_L$ & $b$\\
\hline
$x_t$   & $\frac{1}{4}$     & 1    & $\frac{1}{20}$     & 0     & 20\\
$s_L$   & 6$\frac{1}{4}$    & 0    & -$\frac{3}{4}$     & 1     & 150\\
\hline
Revenue & $p_c$   & $p_t$    & 0     & 0     &\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \caption[Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 0101 with Unknown Prices]
          {Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 0101 with Unknown Prices}
  \label{tab:tcp0101}
\end{table}

From state $0101$ the non-basis variables are $x_c$ and $s_W$ so we
compute the revenue maximizing variables by the usual methods,

\begin{align*}
&\text{argmax}\{p_c - (\frac{1}{4}p_t + 6\frac{1}{4}*0), 0 -
(\frac{1}{20}p_t - \frac{3}{4}*0)\}\\
= &\text{argmax}\{p_c - \frac{1}{4}p_t, -\frac{1}{20}p_t\}
\end{align*}

Since $p_t > 0$ the second option of $-\frac{1}{20}*p_t < 0$ and is
disqualified. From the first option we conclude that if $p_c <
\frac{1}{4}*p_t$ that the simplex algorithm terminates. The results of
this termination are,

\begin{align*}
x_c &= 0\\
x_t &= 20\\
revenue &= 20p_t && \text{ for } p_c < \frac{1}{4}p_t
\end{align*}

For the simplex algorithm to not terminate at this part requires that
$p_c > \frac{1}{4}p_t$. Recall that we are already operating under the assumption
that $p_c < p_t$. Since these two assumptions are compatible (i.e. not
impossible) we continue the simplex algorithm. From the calculation
for entering variable we conclude that $x_c$ is the entering variable
and we must find the exiting variable. Since we have seen this exact
situation in the first example we simply recall the result that $s_L$
is the exiting variable and that the resulting tableau is shown in
table \ref{tab:tcp1100}. Because we are in the same state as before this
new figure is nearly identical to the previous table \ref{tab:tc1100}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | c c c c | c |}
\hline
1100    & $x_c$ & $x_t$ & $s_W$ & $s_L$ & $b$\\
\hline
$x_c$   & 1    & 0    & -0.12   & 0.16     & 24\\
$x_t$   & 0    & 1    & 0.08    & -0.04    & 14\\
\hline
Revenue & $p_c$ & $p_t$    & 0     & 0     &\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \caption[Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 1100 with Unknown Prices]
          {Tables and Chairs Simplex Tableau for State 1100 with Unknown Prices}
  \label{tab:tcp1100}
\end{table}

In the first example, once we reached this state (1100) the simplex
algorithm terminated. As before we attempt to find the entering
variable with the calculation,

\begin{align*}
&\text{argmax}\{0 - (-0.12p_c + 0.08p_t), 0 - (0.16p_c - 0.04p_t)\}\\
= &\text{argmax}\{0.12p_c - 0.08p_t, 0.04p_t - 0.16p_c\}\\
= &\text{argmax}\{3p_c - 2p_t, p_t - 4p_c\}
\end{align*}

For the second option to be positive and therefore available for
consideration requires that $p_t > 4p_c$ which is to say $p_c <
\frac{1}{4}p_t$. However, to reach this state we assumed $p_c >
\frac{1}{4}p_t$ so the second option is not available.

If $p_c < \frac{2}{3}p_t$ then the simplex algorithm terminates just
as it did in the first example since $45 < \frac{2}{3}*80 =
53.33...$. The result in this case is,

\begin{align*}
x_c &= 14\\
x_t &= 24\\
revenue &= 14p_c + 24p_t && \text{ for } \frac{1}{4}p_t < p_c < \frac{2}{3}p_t
\end{align*}

If $\frac{2}{3}p_t < p_c$ then the first option for the entering
variable is available and the entering variable is found to be $s_W$.

The exiting variable in this case is then found as,

\begin{align*}
\text{argmin}\{24 \div -0.12, 14 \div 0.08\}
\end{align*}

Since the first option is negative it is disqualified leaving the
second option and therefore the second of the two basis variables
$x_t$ as the exiting variable. 

Pivoting on the $s_W$ column and the $x_t$ row we have the transition
matrix $B_{1010}$ and its inverse $B_{1010}^{-1}$ as,

\begin{align*}
B_{1010} = \begin{pmatrix}1&-0.12\\0&0.08\end{pmatrix} && 
B_{1010}^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}1&1.5\\0&125.5\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

Applying our transition matrix $B_{1010}^{-1}$ to the $1100$ state
tableau return us to the $1010$ state tableau shown in figure
\ref{tab:tcp1010}.  Since we have determined that state $1010$
terminates we have the following results,

\begin{align*}
x_c &= 45\\
x_t &= 0\\
revenue &= 45p_c && \text{ for } \frac{2}{3}p_t < p_c < p_t
\end{align*}

Because we followed a different path between states to arrive at state
$1010$, the conditions for reaching this state are different. We
notice that the conditions for reaching this state directly from the
initial $0011$ state are $p_t < p_c$ do not intersect the conditions
for reaching this state from state $1010$ as we have just
completed. We combine the two conditions to see that the revenue
outcome of $45p_c$ is reached if $\frac{2}{3}p_t < p_c$.

The result of our investigation is that there are three possible cases
for any pair of positive prices given that all other values in the
tables and chairs example remain the same, that is,

\begin{align*}
\text{Revenue } = \begin{cases}45p_c & \text{ if } \frac{2}{3}p_t < p_c\\
  24p_c + 14p_t & \text{ if } \frac{1}{4}p_t < p_c < \frac{2}{3}p_t\\
  20p_t & \text{ if } p_c < \frac{1}{4}p_t\end{cases}
\end{align*}

The results of this example are summarized by the directed graph in figure
\ref{fig:tc_directed_graph}. The nodes of the graph are the states of
the simplex algorithm allied to this example, the edges are marked
with the conditions under which the simplex algorithm will follow the
edge and the three output cases are labeled $A$, $B$ and $C$
accompanied by the resulting revenue.

Looking ahead, suppose we were given random variables $P_t$ and $P_c$
representing the price of tables and chairs respectively. Even if
$P_t$ and $P_c$ are correlated in some manner they have a joint
distribution which we represent as the shaded region in figure
\ref{fig:tc_joint_prices}. The figure (\ref{fig:tc_joint_prices}) has
three levels of shading with each region labeled with its outcome
($A$, $B$ or $C$) corresponding to the directed graph in figure
\ref{fig:tc_directed_graph}. We note that if the two price random
variables are independent then the shaded region representing the
joint probability distribution of $P_t$ and $P_c$ would be
rectangular.
