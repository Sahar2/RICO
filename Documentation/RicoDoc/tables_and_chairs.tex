\section{Tables and Chairs with Correlated Random Prices}

In this final stage of the tables and chairs example consider correlated random prices. Common practice when writing about economic matters is to develop a story around the problem to help tie the elements together. This practice will be followed for this example.

Suppose that a small furniture manufacturer in Portland, Oregon wants to forecast weekly revenue. The manufacturer makes tables and chairs in a small show with a small crew. Using a forecast for demand for tables, chairs and dinette sets the manufacturer derives the likely market prices for tables and chairs. A dinette set is composed of one table and two chairs.

Figure \ref{fig:TCD} shows the independent random variables corresponding to forecast demand for dinette sets (the exponential curve), tables (the tall Gaussian curve) and chairs (the wide Chi-Squared curve). The vertical axis represents probability density and the horizontal axis represents demand for units (in thousands) in the Portland market.

\begin{figure}

  \caption[Tables, Chairs and Dinette Sets Random Variables]
          {Tables, Chairs and Dinette Sets Random Variables}
  \label{fig:TCD}
\end{figure}

The manufacturer believes that market price and demand for tables are related by the inverse function,

\begin{align*}
P_t = \frac{14*80}{D_t + D_d}
\end{align*}

where $D_t$ is the demand for tables alone and $D_d$ is the demand for dinette sets. Thus $D_t + D_d$ is the total demand for tables. Similarly, the price of chairs is related to the demand for chairs by the inverse function,

\begin{align*}
P_c = \frac{24*45}{D_c + 2D_d}
\end{align*}

where $D_c$ is the demand for chairs alone and again $D_d$ is the demand for dinette sets. The sale of one dinette set implies the sale of two chairs. The actual functions are immaterial and have been contrived so that the results of this version of the tables and chairs example are comparable to previous versions. 

Recognize that $P_t$ and $P_c$ are correlated, but do not need to materialize their joint probability distribution in order to compute revenue results.

The example is data-intensive and prototype software is used to produce numerical results. Rather than presenting the prototype, written in Python using the Numpy library, the data structures and sequence of operations will be described.

Let the input random variables be,

\begin{align*}
Dt &= \{DXt, DPt\}\\
Dc &= \{DXc, DPc\}\\
Dd &= \{DXd, DPd\}
\end{align*}

where,

\begin{align*}
DXt &= (DXt_1, \dots, DXt_{Nt})\\
DPt &= (DPt_1, \dots, DPt_{Nt})\\
DXc &= (DXc_1, \dots, DXc_{Nc})\\
DPc &= (DPc_1, \dots, DPc_{Nc})\\
DXd &= (DXd_1, \dots, DXd_{Nd})\\
DPd &= (DPd_1, \dots, DPd_{Nd})
\end{align*}

assuming that $DPt_{Nt} = DPc_{Nc} = DPd_{Nd} = 0$ as usual for the numeric random variables since probability values are between partition values. Then $Nt$, $Nc$ and $Nd$ as the number of partition endpoints for each input random variable; tables, chairs and dinette sets respectively.

Form the demand joint probability distribution $DP$ for the input random variables by Cartesian product,

\begin{align*}
DP &= DPt \times DPc \times DPd
\end{align*}

Separately form parallel 3D arrays for each input demand,

\begin{align*}
DT &= DXt \times ones(Nc) \times ones(Nd)\\
DC &= ones(Nt) \times DXc \times ones(Nd)\\
DD &= ones(Nt) \times ones(Nc) \times DXd
\end{align*}

where, defining by example,

\begin{align*}
ones(5) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
\end{align*}

Throughout this example presentation 2D diagrams will tend to be preferred to represent 3D objects for clarity. In figure \ref{fig:tcd_rectangle} the demand joint probability $DP$ is represented for a fixed value of $DXd$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{Images/tcd_rectangle}
  \caption[One Layer of Demand Probability Array]
          {One Layer of Demand Probability Array}
  \label{fig:tcd_rectangle}
\end{figure}

In an abuse of notation, when no confusion arises, $t$, $c$ and $d$ are used as both identifiers and indices. The indices for tables, chairs and dinette set random variables are,

\begin{align*}
t &= 1 \dots Nt\\
c &= 1 \dots Nc\\
d &= 1 \dots Nd
\end{align*}

A specific point will be referred to within the demand joint probability array as $DP_{t,c,d}$ or simply $DP_{tcd}$ where the commas are dropped for clarity. The shaded rectangle in figure \ref{fig:tcd_rectangle} is then the demand-space rectangular block of uniform probability distribution with value $DP_{tcd}$.

The four 3D arrays $DT$, $DC$, $DD$ and $DP$ are all parallel. Create other arrays parallel to these. The reason for this parallelism is to ensure that the probability within each block is correctly tracked through each step of the computation process.

The 3D arrays for the prices of tables and chairs are then written,

\begin{align*}
PT &= \frac{14*80}{DT + DD}\\
PC &= \frac{24*45}{DC + 2 DD}
\end{align*}

where the sums, $DT+DD$ and $DC + 2DD$, are computed element-wise as well as the reciprocal functions. The result is that $PT$ and $PC$ are 3D arrays of size $Nt*Nc*Nd$ and are parallel to the demand and demand probability arrays. Note in particular that the price arrays $PT$ and $PC$ are not random variables. They may be converted to random variable form as detailed below. This is possible because values of prices are located at vertices of a block of probability distribution and the value of the probability is uniformly distributed within that block in the 3D array $DP$.

Now that input prices are established for the manufacturer optimization may be applied to decide what combination of tables and chairs to produce. In this example the optimization is computed exhaustively and the demand space is readily paritioned into three output cases $A$, $B$ and $C$. 

Consider that each point in the 3D demand array represents a particular choice of input values that has associated with it two particular prices, one for tables and the other for chairs. It is known, for example, that if $\frac{2}{3}Pt < Pc$ then output $A$ will be selected and similar rules apply for outputs $B$ and $C$. This means that for each point in the 3D demand space a Boolean value $1$ or $0$ can be assigned where $1$ means that point has an associated price for chairs that is larger then two-thirds that of tables. A parallel 3D array of Boolean values called a \emph{mask} based on the optimized output selection rules results. Let,

\begin{align*}
MA &= \frac{2}{3}PT < PC\\
MB &= \frac{1}{4}PT < PC < \frac{2}{3}PT\\
MC &= PC < \frac{1}{4}PT
\end{align*}

Each output is associated with some revenue. Using the price arrays, parallel revenue arrays may be formed. Let,

\begin{align*}
RA &= 45PC\\
RB &= 24PC + 14PT\\
RC &= 20PT
\end{align*}

To convert  the revenue arrays, $RA$, $RB$ and $RC$ into random variables a partition must be identified. Noticing that while the revenue arrays are parallel, the masks indicate that any given point in the array space indexed by $(t,c,d)$ is intended to be present in exactly one revenue array. This is because the output $A$, $B$ and $C$ are mutually exclusive so, for example, the probability of producing \$1000 and \$2000 of revenue using output $A$ can be added to the probability of producing this same range of revenue for output $B$ and for $C$ to arrive at a probability of producing that range of revenue regardless of output choice. 

The partition used for the revenue random variable must span the range of possible revenue values and be fine where there is more revenue information and course where there is less and be so fine overall that numerical artifacts do not overwhelm the result. In this example every $23^rd$ point from each $175$-point input demand random variable is chosen and the problem rerun on the partition values alone, not the probability values. In the Python code this amounts to a single function call since all the code is in place for the main computation. The result is are smaller versions over the same revenue arrays representing collectively a sample of the possible revenue values this example model produces using the given demand inputs. The steps are as follows,

\begin{enumerate}
\item Form one dimensional arrays of valid revenue values for each output.
\item Run the same process as above to generate revenue arrays and output masks. Prepend an $s$ to the name indicating they are small versions due to the reduced partition size.
\item Concatenate the three 1D arrays into a single array called $temp$.
\item Sort the $temporary$ array and remove any duplicates.
\item append the value $-\infty$ to the start of the array and $\infty$ to the end. Call the result $Rx$.
\end{enumerate}

In this case the Python code from the prototype sums up the process concisely,

\begin{align*}
temp &= concatenate((sRA[sMA], sRB[sMB], sRC[sMC]))\\
Rx &= concatenate(([-\infty], unique(temp), [+\infty]))
\end{align*}

where $sRA[sMA]$ returns a one dimensional array from an arbitrary array only for points where the corresponding point in the $sMA$ small output mask array is a $1$ and $unique()$ sorts and removes duplicates from an array. 

For each (big) output array $RA$, $RB$ and $RC$ with associated masks $MA$, $MB$ and $MC$ a one dimensional array is created for the probability distribution that is parallel to the one dimensional partition array $Rx$. 

\begin{align*}
Rap &= zeros(Rx)\\
Rbp &= zeros(Rx)\\
Rcp &= zeros(Rx)
\end{align*}

where, defining by example,

\begin{align*}
zeros(5) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
\end{align*}

The probability arrays, once filled in, will complete the formation of the output revenue random variables,

\begin{align*}
Ra &= \{Rx, Rap\}\\
Rb &= \{Rx, Rbp\}\\
Rc &= \{Rx, Rcp\}
\end{align*}

The three output random variables $Ra$, $Rb$ and $Rc$ are mutually exclusive and since they share a common partition their probability values are summable to find the final output revenue random variable $R$,

\begin{align*}
R = \{Rx, Rap + Rbp + Rcp\}
\end{align*}

It remains to describe how to fill in the probability arrays $Rap$, $Rbp$ and $Rcp$. The process for $Rap$ is the same for the others.

Given the (big) output revenue 3D array $RA$, its associated mask $MA$, the associated 3D probability array $DP$ and the 1D revenue partition $Rx$ the zero-valued 1D probability array $Rap$ may be created using the following steps. 

The output revenue 3D array $RA$ together with the associated probability array $DP$ describes a partition of the joint demand (input) space into blocks. Recall that the blocks have indices $t$,$c$ and $d$ so that the $(t,c,d)$ block has uniform probability $DP_{tcd}$ and eight vertices with the following revenues,

\begin{align*}
RA_{t,c,d} && RA_{t,c,d+1} && RA_{t,c+1,d} && RA_{t,c+1,d+1}\\
RA_{t+1,c,d} && RA_{t+1,c,d+1} && RA_{t+1,c+1,d} && RA_{t+1,c+1,d+1}
\end{align*}

for some block such that $1 \le t < Nt$, $1 \le c < Nc$ and $1 \le d < Nd$. If all the vertices are \emph{valid}, that is, the associated mask value is $1$ for each vertex then figure \ref{fig:block_projection} symbolically represents one possible scenario.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{Images/block_projection}
  \caption[Line Projection of 3D Probability Block]
          {Line Projection of 3D Probability Block}
  \label{fig:block_projection}
\end{figure}

The limits of the 3D block projection are the minimum and maximum revenue vertex values. That is,

\begin{align*}
min_{tcd} &= Min(RA_{t,c,d}, \dots, RA_{t+1,c+1,d+1})\\
max_{tcd} &= Max(RA_{t,c,d}, \dots, RA_{t+1,c+1,d+1})
\end{align*}

For the software prototype version of this example it is assumed that the 3D block probability $DP_{t,c,d}$ is distributed uniformly over the revenue line segment $(min, max)$ so that the density is $h_{tcd}$,

\begin{align*}
h_{tcd} = \frac{DP_{tcd}}{max_{tcd} - max_{tcd}}
\end{align*}

where it is assumed that $min_{tcd} < max_{tcd}$. The special cases when $min_{tcd}$ and $max_{tcd}$ are equal will be detailed below. Continuing with the general case the uniform probability density $h_{tcd}$ is allocated to the revenue probability array $Rap$ recalling that $Rap$ is delimited by the partition array $Rx$. Referring to figure \ref{fig:line_projection},

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{Images/line_projection}
  \caption[Partition Allocation of Probability Line]
          {Partition Allocation of Probability Line}
  \label{fig:line_projection}
\end{figure}

\begin{align*}
Rap_i &= Rap_i + (Rx_{i+1} - min_{tcd}) h_{tcd}\\
\dots\\
Rap_{i+3} &= Rap_{i+3} + (Rx_{i+4} - Rx_{i+3}) h_{tcd}\\
Rap_{i+4} &= Rap_{i+4} + (max_{tcd} - Rx_{i+4}) h_{tcd} 
\end{align*}

where it is indicated how to compute end cases as well as cases where $Rx$ partitions are spanned by the $(min_{tcd}, max_{tcd})$ interval. 

If the mask $MA$ indicates that some of the vertices of the $(t,c,d)$ block are not valid then the amount of block probability $DP_{tcd}$ available for allocation must be reduced. For example, if $3$ of $8$ vertices are valid for the $(t,c,d)$ block then the block probability is correspondingly reduced to $\frac{3}{8}DP_{tcd}$ so that the $(min_{tcd}, max_{tcd})$ interval probability density is,

\begin{align*}
h_{tcd} = \frac{3}{8}\frac{DP_{tcd}}{max_{tcd} - max_{tcd}}
\end{align*}

If it happened that $min_{tcd} = max_{tcd}$ either because all the valid vertices have the same revenue value or there is only one valid vertex for the $(t,c,d)$ block then the corresponding partition element is located for the $Rap$ array and its value is incremented with the available probability for that block. If it happens that $min_{tcd} = max_{tcd}$ equals an $Rx$ partition endpoint then the available block probability is halved and allocated to the adjacent partition intervals.

Perform the above operations for each output case and combine them into the full revenue random variable and show the result in figure \ref{fig:ABC_4}. The horizontal axis is dollars of revenue and vertical axis is probability density as usual for random variable graphs. Notice that the median value is roughly \$2200 because of careful choice of demand inputs and the demand-to-price functional relationship.

\end{figure}



Notable features of the optimized revenue in any panel of figure \ref{fig:ABC_4} is that no matter what happens with the projected demand there is a non-zero minimum revenue (about \$300), a strongly likelihood of earning about \$2200 and significant possibility of earning considerably more than the median \$2200.

Use the machinery developed above to convert the 3D price arrays to random variables. Since there is no optimization involved in computing prices there is no need to generate masks. Since some information is available about the range of prices to expect price partitions may be chosen directly. In this case each price is partitioned into regularly spaced intervals from 0 to \$150. The 3D probability arrays are projected onto the price partitions and the result for each price random variable is shown in figure \ref{fig:tcd_prices}. Notice that, by design, the price of chairs is has a median price of about \$45 and that of tables is about \$80 which corresponds with the sharp version of the tables and chairs example.

  \caption[Random Variable Table and Chair Prices]
          {Random Variable Table and Chair Prices}
  \label{fig:tcd_prices}
\end{figure}

Notice that the price random variables are marginal probability distributions for a joint probability distribution are not computed. Since the price for tables and chairs are non-trivially correlated the joint distribution cannot be recovered from the marginal distributions alone as described in a standard statistics textbook such as \cite{bickel01}. 

\subsection{Finding the Joint Price Distribution from the Demand Inputs}

The reader will notice that the tables and chairs example with unknown prices is developed in preparation for the introduction of random inputs resulting in correlated prices. How to proceed with a joint distribution was described for the two prices, tables and chairs. Then the problem was solved without using, or even finding, the joint price distribution. Instead the 3D array was created to represent the three demand inputs. For this problem this technique provides directed and satisfactory results.

In this section the tables and chairs is revisited example with the same three demand input, but this time produce the joint price probability distribution. Since so much of this work is devoted to the study of correlated random variables it would be remiss not to include at least one example of same.

The problem with three 3D demand arrays, $DT$, $DC$ and  $DD$ is now revisted. The associated 3D probability array $DP$ is also available. Using the same formulas as before for finding the (correlated) prices of tables and chairs the two 3D price arrays $PT$ and $PC$ respectively follow. 

Each 3D price array may be projected onto a price partition and produced random variable representations of the two prices in figure \ref{fig:tcd_prices}. Choose the same price partitions as before, evenly space intervals from \$0 to \$150. This choice allows for comparable results with those obtained previously.

The two price partitions, for $PT$ and $PC$, describe a 2D partition of the $(Pc,Pt)$-space. If the number of points in each price partition is $Np$ then a 2D array of size $Np^2$ is created and initialized with zero values.

Notice that the two 3D price arrays $PT$ and $PC$ together describe a 3D lattice of pairs of prices at each vertex surrounding a uniform distribution of probability described by the 3D probability array $DP$. The 8 vertices of each probability block, each containing the two price values, are projected onto the two dimensional $(Pc, Pt)$-space. This the 2D analog of the 1D procedure for finding each marginal price random variable by projecting each price block for $PT$ or $PC$ onto the corresponding one dimensional price line. Figure \ref{fig:ptc_rectangle} shows an example of price block vertex projection. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{Images/ptc_rectangle}
  \caption[Joint Price Partition with Block Vertex Projections]
          {Joint Price Partition with Block Vertex Projections}
  \label{fig:ptc_rectangle}
\end{figure}

Since the cluster of vertex projections in figure \ref{fig:ptc_rectangle} indicate the projection of the 3D price probability block onto the 2D joint price partition the block probability must be allocated accordingly. 

Assuming that the cluster of vertex projections represent the limits of the block projection the convex hull of these points may be found using an algorithm such as the Graham Scan as described in a textbook of computer algorithms such as Corman \cite{corman09}. Assume the block probability is distributed uniformly over the interior region of the convex hull and apportion it accordingly to the partition rectangles of the 2D price distribution, called $JP$. Figure \ref{fig:ptc_rectangle_convex} shows the convex hull of the projected vertices. The heavy outline of joint price rectangles shows the limits of affected rectangles. Let $p$ be the probability of the projected block and $a$ the area of the convexregion, then $h = p/a$ is the probability density. The portion of probability allocated to any given rectangle in the outlined region is $h$ times the area of the rectangle intersecting the convex region.

\begin{figure}

  \caption[Joint Price Partition with Convex Block Projection]
          {Joint Price Partition with Convex Block Projection}
  \label{fig:ptc_rectangle_convex}
\end{figure}

The tables and chairs example has over 5 million blocks to project so a complex computation of multiple rectangle intersections with convex regions associated with each block is avoided for the prototype code. A simpler, though less accurate, approach is shown in figure \ref{fig:ptc_rectange_rectangle}. The heavy outline bounding box represents the $Pt$ and $Pc$ partition limits bounding the block vertex cluster. The shaded inner rectangle represents the rectangular limits of the cluster points. Calculate the probability density of the block probability as if distributed uniformly over the inner shaded rectangle and distribute this by area over each intersecting price rectangle.

\end{figure}

The results of the calculations of the prototype code for the joint probability distribution of the two correlated prices is shown in figure \ref{fig:Ptc}. Be aware that the origin is located in the upper-left corner of the graph. The $x$ and $y$ axis are prices of tables and chairs respectively and the vertical axis is probability density.

\end{figure}

An top view of the joint probability price distribution is shown figure \ref{fig:Ptc_flat}. Compare this figure to the original suggestion of the joint probability distribution of prices in figure \ref{fig:tc_joint_prices}. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=120mm]{Images/Ptc_flat.eps}
  \caption[Joint Probability Distribution of Table and Chair Prices (Top View)]
          {Joint Probability Distribution of Table and Chair Prices (Top View)}
  \label{fig:Ptc_flat}
\end{figure}

It is interesting to note that the marginal random variable prices computed with the prototype code are identical to the random variable price computed previously and show in figure \ref{fig:tcd_prices}.

With the joint distribution of prices in hand the question of how to compute the probability of each branch in the simplex graph (see figure \ref{fig:tc_directed_graph}) is addressable. The probabilities of the branch conditional expressions are of particular interest,

\begin{align*}
p_t &< p_c\\
\frac{2}{3}p_t &< p_c\\
\frac{2}{3}p_t &< p_c < p_t\\
\frac{1}{4}p_t &< p_c\\
\frac{1}{4}p_t &< p_c < \frac{2}{3}p_t
\end{align*}

Proceeding as before, but starting with the jointly distributed prices and their partitions $P_t$ and $P_c$ 2D arrays $PT_2$ and $PT_2$ are created parallel to the 2D joint probability distribution array $JP$. Taking the last inequality above as an example each expression is devided by $p_t$ to find,

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{4} < \frac{p_c}{p_t} < \frac{2}{3}
\end{align*}

In the prototype the 2D array expression $Qtc$ is formed as,

\begin{align*}
Qtc = \frac{PC_2}{PT_2}
\end{align*}

as the element-wise quotient of the two 2D price arrays. Notice that $Qtc$ together with the $JP$ form an improper form two-dimensional random variable, a non-standard usage of the expression. If a 1D partition is chosen for $Qtc$ the $\{Qtc, JP\}$ pair can be projected onto this partition and find a proper-form random variable, called $qtc$. This case is addressable by choosing the special partition,

\begin{align*}
Xqtc = (-\infty, 0, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{3}, 1, \infty)
\end{align*}

The result is,

\begin{align*}
Pqtc = (0, 0.0001012, 0.7206, 0.2388, 0.03024, 0)
\end{align*}

Combining these into the random variable $Q$ for convenience as,

\begin{align*}
Q = \{Xqtc, Pqtc\}
\end{align*}

These probability values tell us probability of each simplex directed graph branch and therefore the probability of each result. For example, referring to figure \ref{fig:tc_directed_graph}, the probability of taking the first left directed edge under the condition that $p_t < p_c$ is  $\mathbb{P}(1 < Q) = 0.03024$. Similarly the probability of reaching result $B$ is $\mathbb{P}(\frac{1}{4} < Q < \frac{2}{3}) = 0.7206$.

\subsection{Tables and Chairs with Unknowns Prices and Resources}

Allowing prices and resources to be described by correlated random variables the impact on the example is to increase the number of branches from each simplex algorithm states and an increase in the number of states. The simplex tableau for unknown prices and resources is shown in table \ref{tab:pr0011}.

The directed graph for the tables and chairs example with unknown prices and resources is shown in figure \ref{fig:tcpr_directed_graph}. Notice that there are only $\mathbb{C}(4,2) = 6$ possible node states in this example. Notice also that there are $5$ possible terminal states; manufacture of only tables or only chair limited by either wood resource or labor resource and also the mixed case.

Starting in state $0011$ and following the simplex two-phase decision and first compare the two prices $p_c$ and $p_t$. Assuming for clarity, as before, that since it is intended to replace $p_c$ and $p_t$ with continuous random variables the probability of equality is zero. In practice the possibility of equality must be checked. The initial comparisons are,

\begin{align*}
argmax(p_c, p_t)\\
argmin(\frac{b_W}{5}, \frac{b_L}{10}  | > 0 \text{ and } p_c > p_t)\\
argmin(\frac{b_W}{20}, \frac{b_L}{15} | > 0 \text{ and } p_c < p_t)
\end{align*}

where the $> 0$ condition refers to the requirement that each operand be positive else it is disqualified from the comparison.

In many cases the first or second phase of the simplex algorithm decision is disqualified since it is either non-positive or contradicts a previous assumption. 

Since simplex states may be re-entered a computer algorithm can take advantage of this possibility and cache, rather than recompute, certain elements such as the simplex tableau. Notice the comparison of linear combinations of either price or resource variables with zero, at each decision potin, in the sense that the expression $a < b$ can be rewritten as $0 < b - a$. Recall from the previous version of the tables and chairs example that each conditional statement results in a filter on the input space so that the simplex algorithm may be viewed as a filtration process. The task of the RICO modeling environment is to determine what portion of the input space passes through each facet of the simplex filtration process to a terminal node and with what probability.

\section{Beyond the Tables and Chairs Example}

In the tables and chairs example correlated random inputs for prices were chosen and it was argued that correlated random inputs could have been chosen for resources instead. Notice in the simplex algorithm the transition decision from one state to the other involves computing the maximum positive revenue impact in the case of prices and then the minimum positive resource impact. These two choices correspond to the two facets of a table pivot as explained above. 

It remains to be investigated what happens to this example when some or all of the values of $A$ are unknown. In this example the significance of unknown $A$ values is that the manufacturer is unsure how many resources are consumed by each product.

As explained by Bellman \cite{bellman03}, the number of solution states, not to mention the number of internal simplex algorithm states, becomes computationally intractable even for modest problems. Notice that if the problem has 100 variables and 100 constraints then the number of simplex states is at least $\mathbb{Ch}(200,100) = 9.05\times10^{58}$. The reference implementation of the AB32 model has many hundreds of variables and several thousand constraint equations. 

A way to proceed is for the RICO modeling environment to partially explore the simplex directed graph. The transition from one state to the next using the simplex algorithm involves finding the maximum of a set of linear combinations of prices, in the context of the tables and chairs example, followed by finding the minimum of a set of linear combinations of resource limits assuming the $A$ values are fixed. Each \emph{choice element} is a linear combination of random variables which are themselves random variables. Assuming that there are three choice elements denoted $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ then the decision,

\begin{align*}
argmax\{X, Y, Z\}
\end{align*}

results in three probability values,

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(X < \{Y, Z\})\\
\mathbb{P}(Y < \{X,Z\})\\
\mathbb{P}(Z < \{X,Y\})
\end{align*}

In this case the simplex algorithm state has three initial branches corresponding to the first decision of the pivot element. These probabilities may be computed explicitly and rather than create a directed graph with all choices listed as done above with the tables and chairs directed graph, choose only the most highest probability transition. In this manner a terminal node is reached as in the sharp version of the simplex algorithm. 

Since it's possible to assign probability values to each transition edge in the directed graph a choice algorithm may be applied to explore other paths based on their likelihood of occurrence. As long as the directed graph remains at least partly unexplored, it is suspected that this is the case in general, then the random variable results will not have \emph{full   probability}, that is, their probability values will sum to less than one. The proximity of the probability sum of a random variable result to unity can be used as a criterion for algorithm termination. That is, if the random variable result is deemed near enough to completion the algorithm can terminate its exploration of the simplex directed graph.
